Plugin to monitor your myriand of your wordpress sites if they are up to date

== Description ==

The plugin have 2 main tasks:
1. When installed it can report the current version of wordpress when requestes. Don't worry it needs a security 
token to be provided.
2. It has an interface where the admins can import all of their sites with this plugin and can see at glance which 
wordpress is outdated and need an update.

= Who could benefit from this plugin? =

This is useful for website owners who have multiple websites and they couldn't keep what version each of
the wordpress has. The outdated versions are always a security risk and it's a good idea to know and 
update them whenever you can.

It's always better to have "Auto update" enabled, but sometimes this is not the case. And this plugin
should solve this.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin using the Plugin installer or from the Wordpress store

== Configuration ==

1. Go to your wordpress dashboard and find the menu Version Reporter on the left hand menu
2. Create a security token (This token would be the same for all your sites so make it secure). 
Using the "Generate Now" button would create 30 character length string
3. Install the plugin on all your other websites and use the same token in all of them.
4. Add all your sites in one of the websites (usually the main one or any other of your choice)
5. Click the "Check Version" button and all versions would appear next to the websites on the table.
